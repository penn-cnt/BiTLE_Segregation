# Repository for analyses related to the manuscript: "Resting State Functional Connectivity Demonstrates Increased Segregation in Bilateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy"

For the full manuscript see: https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17565

## Accessing the fully processed connectivity matrices

Links to the fully processed functional connectivity matrices are available here: https://osf.io/xs2q6/

## Running the analyses

We provide a stand-alone Jupyter notebook as a companion to the manuscript. The notebook runs all the analyses required to generate the figures and findings in the manuscript.

### Installing the Conda virtual environment

Please make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed. 

In order to run the analysis, clone this repository and download the processed functional connectivity matrices from the OSF link above. After download, place the downloaded binary file in the `/data` folder and open the the `code/processing_analysis_final.ipynb` notebook. If the conda environment was setup appropriately and the connectivity matrices were placed in the correct folder, everything should run correctly.
